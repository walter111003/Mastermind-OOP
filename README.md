I coded a game called Mastermind (Java) where the player has 12 chances to guess a secret code of four colored pegs. 
Feedback is given after each guess using black (correct color and position) and white (correct color, wrong position) pegs.


OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Design: 


Driver Class: Starts and manages the game execution.
Game Class: Handles game logic, including user input and guess processing.
History Class: Stores and displays the history of guesses and feedback.
Compare Class: Compares the playerâ€™s guess with the secret code and calculates the black and white pegs.
